# Menty | Depression Detection

A voice-based depression detection app that listens to you talk and tells you if you might be experiencing symptoms of depression. Think of it as a digital mood ring that actually works.

## What It Does

You talk, it listens. It analyzes your voice patterns and content to detect potential signs of depression. Think of it as a digital friend who's always there to listen (but won't judge you for talking to your plants).

## Features

🎤 Voice recording with fancy soundwave visualization  
🤖 AI-powered analysis of your voice for depression indicators  
🔊 Reads results back to you (because reading is hard)  
🌙 Dark mode for those late-night wellness checks  

## How to Use

1. Open the app
2. Click the microphone button
3. Talk about your feelings (or what you had for breakfast)
4. Get your depression risk analysis
5. Repeat until you feel better or get tired of talking
